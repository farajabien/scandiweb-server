# scandiweb-server

Welcome to scandiweb-server, an express REST API.

To get started, make sure you have Node.js and npm (the package manager for Node.js) installed on your machine.

Then, open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this project. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

`npm install`

Once the installation is complete, you can start the server by running:

`npm start`

This will start the server on port 8000. You can then access the API endpoints by making HTTP requests to localhost:8000.

Note: if you wish to run the server on a different port, you can specify the port number as an environment variable when starting the server:

`PORT=3000 npm start`
